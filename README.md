## 📋 Project Description

This is a portfolio website built as part of the **Web Development Challenge**. The website showcases a clean, responsive design to display a designer’s services, projects, testimonials, and contact information.

Our team collaborated to plan, structure, and develop the website. The main goals were to:
* Practice HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap skills.
* Recreate a modern portfolio design with custom touches.
* Ensure responsiveness across all devices.
